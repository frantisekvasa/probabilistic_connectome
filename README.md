# Probabilistic thresholding of functional connectomes

The code in this repository reproduces most analyses and figures (with the exception of certain supplementary analyses) conducted in the manuscript "**Probabilistic thresholding of functional connectomes: application to schizophrenia**" by František Váša et al.

The main analysis script is **probabilistic_connectome.m**. The remaining scripts contain plotting and statistical functions used within the main script. The main code also depends on a few additional functions (as described in comments on lines 22-27 of the main analysis script).

For details regarding the motivation behind analyses and the interpretation of results, see the manuscript, available at: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811917310649.
